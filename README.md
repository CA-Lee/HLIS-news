### Introduction

This is just a Sideproject for practicing python and social-community api. It can grab out the announces of HLIS's offcial website, then forward them to my facebook page(I will develop the other features of forward to IG even line robot). I'm going to make this program grab out the text in the content of the link, then we can seldom be redirected to outside browser. And I'll try to convert pdf files into images, because it is really storage-consuming and time-consuming to open pdf files in smartphone.

That's all, welcome for any issues or PR!!
